This repo contains the source code for the Tic-Tac-Func players: AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. Both of them are currently written in nodejs.

__Yes, the players are currently really stupid.__ Do you want to make AWS Lambda smarter than the Azure Function? Or, should Azure be the winner of the Func Games?
__Evolve the players. Create an AI - targeting World Domination - by contributing to this project.__

Here is the source code for user interface part (consumer of this API) of the game: https://github.com/DavidVujic/tictacfunc
